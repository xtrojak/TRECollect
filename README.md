# TRECollect

[![Unit Tests](actions/workflows/unit_tests.yml/badge.svg)](actions/workflows/unit_tests.yml)

TRECollect is an Android application for collecting and managing field sampling metadata with custom logsheets. The app enables researchers to create sampling sites, fill out dynamic forms, capture GPS locations, take photos, and upload submissions to centralized storage for processing.

## Features

- **Team-Based Configuration**
  - Select sampling team (LSI or AML)
  - For LSI team, select subteam (Soil, Sediment, or Shoreline)
  - Team/subteam selection determines available forms and folder structure
  - Initial setup requires team selection before use

- **Sampling Site Management**
  - Create and manage ongoing and finished sampling sites
  - Organize sites in team/subteam-based folder hierarchy
  - Track site status and upload progress

- **Dynamic Form System**
  - JSON-configured custom logsheets organized by team/subteam
  - Team-specific form configurations:
    - LSI teams have distinct forms for Soil, Sediment, and Shoreline sampling
    - AML team has specialized forms for contaminated site assessment
  - Support for multiple field types:
    - Text, number, and date inputs
    - Multi-select options
    - GPS location picker with map integration
    - Photo capture
    - Table fields with rows and columns
    - Dynamic fields with sub-fields
    - Section grouping
  - Draft and submitted form states
  - Form data persistence

- **Offline Capabilities**
  - Offline map support using OpenStreetMap
  - Download map regions for offline GPS usage
  - Automatic cleanup of expired map regions

- **Data Synchronization**
  - Automatic upload to ownCloud on site completion
  - Manual upload and re-upload capabilities
  - Batch upload for multiple sites
  - Upload status tracking with visual indicators

- **Data Management**
  - Room database for local persistence
  - XML-based form data storage
  - Team/subteam-based folder organization:
    - Local: `TREC_logsheets/{team}/{subteam}/{ongoing,finished,deleted}/`
    - ownCloud: `{UUID}/{team}/{subteam}/{siteName}/`

## Requirements

- Android 7.0 (API level 24) or higher
- Internet connection for ownCloud uploads
- Storage access for saving form data and offline maps

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (latest stable version)
- JDK 17 or higher
- Android SDK with API level 34

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd TRECollect
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Sync Gradle files and wait for dependencies to download

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

### Configuration

**Initial Setup (Required on First Launch):**

1. **Select Sampling Team**: Choose your team (LSI or AML)
   - If LSI is selected, choose subteam (Soil, Sediment, or Shoreline)
   - This determines which forms are available and the folder structure

2. **Select Output Folder**: Choose where submissions will be stored
   - The app will create the folder structure: `TREC_logsheets/{team}/{subteam}/`

3. **Optional - ownCloud (uploads and logsheet downloads):** Credentials are **not** in the repo. Copy `local.properties.example` to `local.properties` and set:
   - `owncloud.url`: Your ownCloud WebDAV base URL (e.g. `https://oc.example.com/public.php/webdav/`)
   - `owncloud.access_token`: Token for the upload share
   - `owncloud.logsheets_token`: Token for the logsheets download share  
   If these are missing or empty, the app will build but upload/download to ownCloud will not work until configured.

**CI (GitHub Actions):** The "Build Debug APK" workflow needs ownCloud credentials to produce an APK that can upload/download. In your repo, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:
- `OWNCLOUD_URL` – WebDAV base URL
- `OWNCLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN` – upload share token  
- `OWNCLOUD_LOGSHEETS_TOKEN` – logsheets share token  

The workflow creates `local.properties` from these secrets before building. If the secrets are not set, the APK still builds but with empty ownCloud config.

**Note**: The app requires team selection and output folder configuration before you can create sites.

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests and instrumented tests. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed information.

### Running Unit Tests Locally

```bash
# Run all unit tests (recommended)
./scripts/run-tests.sh

# Or use Gradle directly
./gradlew test

# View test summary
./scripts/test-summary.sh
```

### Running Instrumented Tests Locally

Instrumented tests require an Android device or emulator to be connected.

```bash
# Check if device/emulator is connected
./scripts/check-device.sh

# Run all instrumented tests
./scripts/run-instrumented-tests.sh

# Or use Gradle directly
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

# Run specific test class
./scripts/run-instrumented-tests.sh "com.trec.customlogsheets.database.SamplingSiteDaoTest"
```

### Test Coverage

**Unit Tests:**
- Data layer (TypeConverters, data classes, form configuration)
- Business logic (ViewModel factories, utility functions)
- Form data structures and validation

**Instrumented Tests:**
- Database operations (Room DAOs, migrations, TypeConverters)
- Database CRUD operations with real SQLite

See the [test summary](actions) for the latest test results.
